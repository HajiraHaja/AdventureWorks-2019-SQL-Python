Project Overview

This project includes information that covers various aspects of organisational dynamics, aiming to provide further insight and understanding. We investigated the relationships between store size, employee count, revenue, store trading duration, sick leave hours across job titles, and annual leave with bonus amounts. This will help us to identify patterns, trends and any correlation that may prove to be useful going forward.
