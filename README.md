Project Overview

This project includes information that covers various aspects of organisational dynamics, aiming to provide further insight and understanding. We investigated the relationships between store size, employee count, revenue, store trading duration, sick leave hours across job titles, and annual leave with bonus amounts. This will help us to identify patterns, trends and any correlation that may prove to be useful going forward.

The data shows that the US was the best performing region out of all the countries listed. With the Southwest region, coming up as the top region for the US.

This scatter plot shows a moderate positive correlation coefficient between annual leave taken and bonuses given, Which is a statistical measure of the strength of a relationship between 2 variables. Overall this shows a noticeable trend, as presented with the trend line. 
3. What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?

We can see a clear distribution of revenue across 5 different counties. USA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE and Germany
- USA currently has the highest revenue
- Indicating that they make up the vast majority of total revenue across all countries
- This could link to market size and other factors
